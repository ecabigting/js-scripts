# js-scripts
This is a collection of short javascript files I created to automate some task for a school management system.

1. Mark Scheme Script
 - This is a script that I run on a browser console(preferably in chrome) to fill out textboxes for a mark scheme form.
 - The scripts needs to three(3) types of data.
   a. The subject ID number
   b. The mark type(ei. passing, overall) id
   c. The mark category(quizes, midterm, homework, etc.)
 - I manually obtain this by opening the source code of the page and check the id given to the textbox. The textboxes has this id format for what I understand `<mark type>?<subject id>?<mark category>`
